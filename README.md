# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA

This project is about Customer Credit Card Data Analysis is a part of the UNP academic curriculum aimed at developing practical skills in data analysis using Microsoft Excel. The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about customer demographics, credit card usage, and spending behavior. The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the data to extract meaningful insights that can support business decisions, especially in the areas of marketing and customer relationship management.
Using Excel, the data was first cleaned and prepared for analysis. Various BI tools within Excel—such as pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting—were utilized to explore patterns and trends in customer behavior. Key metrics such as monthly spending, transaction frequency, and product category preferences were visualized through interactive dashboards. The analysis also included customer segmentation based on usage and spending habits, which can be valuable for targeted marketing strategies.
